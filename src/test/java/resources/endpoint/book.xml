    <title>The European Languages</title>
    <body>
      The European languages are members of the same family. Their separate existence is a myth. For
      science, music, sport, etc, Europe uses the same vocabulary. The languages only differ in
      their grammar, their pronunciation and their most common words. Everyone realizes why a new
      common language would be desirable: one could refuse to pay expensive translators.
